# MERN Full-stack doctor appointments app

Main technologies: React.js, Express.js, Node.js, and MongoDB

## For demo

There are already three users as demo users.
1, Name: Admin, Email: admin@gmail.com, Password: 1234 (admin)
2, Name: Kevin, Email: kevin@gmail.com, Password: 1234 (doctor)
3, Name: User, Email: user@gmail.com, Password: 1234 (user)

Only the admin can see all of users and doctors.

### Basic flow and function

This is a booking website as a health managiment. The user can create a new booking for the doctor and apply for the doctor as well. The doctor can see any appointment notifications after users create. The Admin can organize every application of doctor. Also, each user is managed by the email and password. So, the user can create a new account, too.

### Deployment

I used Vercel for deployment, both for the back-end and the front-end.
